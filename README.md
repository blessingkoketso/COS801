# CryptoAnalytics: Cryptocoins Price Forecasting with Machine Learning Techniques - COS801 project 
The main objective of the project is to reproduce the results detailed in the CryptoAnalytics: Cryptocoins Price Forecasting with Machine Learning Techniques paper. The basic idea behind the paper is the prediction of cryptocurrency prices using machine learning. The first aspect of the prediction is the usage of tree models and followed by deep learning models. The recurrent neural networks are the deep learning models used for the prediction. The RNNs are suitable for this task since the cryptocurrency data is sequential. 
# Installation
The Python version used is 3.11. We suggest you run the notebook on Google Colab for better performance and easy access to GPU workloads.
